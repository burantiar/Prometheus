# Prometheus

This toolkit was produced  as part of a "Prometheus" research project, developed under the [Future of Marketing Initiative (FOMI)](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/research/centres-and-initiatives/oxford-future-marketing-initiative). The Prometheus initiative is driving the future of marketing with a unique partnership between academia (FOMI) and industry ([Teradata](https://www.teradata.co.uk)).  The main goal of the Prometheus project is to facilitate the adoption of AI and machine learning (ML) tools for marketing applications. 

The core of this project is a collection of open-source ML tools for common marketing problems. We aim to deliver easily accessible code for both marketing academics and industry professionals. The project includes three main topics: 1) traditional ML tools for marketing applications, 2) natural language processing (NLP) and 3) computer vision (CV) methods. Some of the methods are not related to marketing specifically, but are beneficial for marketing students, interested in AI.

Traditional ML tools include such topics as clustering, attribution models and recommender systems. NLP section covers such topics as word embeddings, language models and sentiment analysis. CV section discusses image classification and creative content development. This toolbox will allow researchers to access marketing tools, to understand their basic functionality and even design simple analytics tools from scratch.
